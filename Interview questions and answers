INTRO : Netscape developed JavaScript and was created by Brenden Eich in the year of 1995.

1.  Define closure.
   --> In JavaScript, we need closures when a variable which is defined outside the scope in reference is accessed from some inner scope.
for example:
var num = 10;  
function sum()   
{  
document.writeln(num+num);  
}   
sum();  

2. What is the difference between JavaScript and JScript?
  --> In other words, you can say JScript is the same as JavaScript, but Microsoft provides it.

3. How do you handle asynchronous operations in javascript?
for example : 
// Creating a Promise that resolves to success
const successPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Simulating a successful asynchronous operation
  const success = true;

  if (success) {
    resolve("Operation completed successfully");
  } else {
    reject("Operation failed");
  }
});

// Creating a Promise that resolves to an error
const errorPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Simulating a failed asynchronous operation
  const success = false;

  if (success) {
    resolve("Operation completed successfully");
  } else {
    reject("Operation failed");
  }
});

4. write example of setTimeout.
for example :
function first(){
    console.log("welcome")
}

function second(){
    console.log("second")
}
setTimeout(first,3000)
first()
second()

5. write example of setInterval.
for example :
function first(){
    console.log("welcome")
}

function second(){
    console.log("second")
}
setInterval(first,3000)
first()
second()

6. what is callback function in javascript ?
  --> A JavaScript callback is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished execution.
for example :
 function one() {
     console.log("I'm funtion_1");
 };
function two(callBack) { 
    console.log("I'm function_2"); 
    callBack();
};
two(one)

7. explain in difference between == and === in javascript.
  --> == in JavaScript is used for comparing two variables, but it ignores the datatype of variable. === is used for comparing two variables, but this operator also checks datatype and compares two values.

8. How to create new object ?
  --> The first way is by using the new keyword, which creates a new empty object. The new keyword works like this: you give it a variable name, optionally followed by arguments to initialise its properties.
Example:
var x = new Number(5);. 

9. what is use of map and filter in javascript?
  --> map() and . filter() are all just other ways of iterating through arrays to perform a specific task on each element of the array, and are called methods.
  --> The map method is used to convert each item of an array, while the filter method is used to select certain items of an array .

10. Explain Implicit Type Coercion in javascript.
  --> Implicit type coercion in javascript is the automatic conversion of value from one data type to another.
for example :
var x = 3;
var y = "3";
x + y // Returns "33" 

11. Explain passed by value and passed by reference.
  --> In JavaScript, primitive data types are passed by value and non-primitive data types are passed by reference.
for example : 
# passed by value : 
var y = 234;
var z = y;
#passed by reference :
var obj = { name: "Vivek", surname: "Bisht" };
var obj2 = obj;

12. explain session storage and local storage.
  --> The sessionStorage object stores data for only one session.(The data is deleted when the browser is closed).
  --> The localStorage Object which stores data with no expiration date.(The data is not deleted when the browser is closed, and are available in future sessions).
  --> Both let you store key/value pairs in the browser.

13.  What is NaN property in JavaScript?
  --> In JavaScript, NaN is short for "Not-a-Number". In JavaScript, NaN is a number that is not a legal number. The Number. isNaN() method returns true if the value is NaN , and the type is a Number.

14. What are the types of errors in javascript?
  --> Syntax error: Syntax errors are mistakes or spelling problems in the code that cause the program to not execute at all or to stop running halfway through. Error messages are usually supplied as well.
  --> Logical error: Reasoning mistakes occur when the syntax is proper but the logic or program is incorrect. 

15. What are undeclared and undefined variables?
  --> Undefined: It occurs when a variable is declare not not assign any value. Undefined is not a keyword.
  --> Undeclared: It occurs when we try to access any variable which is not initialize or declare earlier using the var or const keyword. 

16. What do you mean by NULL in JavaScript?
   --> The NULL value represents that no value or no object. It is known as empty value/object.

17.  What are the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?
  --> There are three types of pop boxes available in JavaScript.
      * Alert()
      * Confirm()
      * Prompt()

18. What is the difference between an alert box and a confirmation box?
  --> An alert box will display only one button which is the OK button. It is used to inform the user about the agreement has to agree. But a Confirmation box displays two buttons OK and cancel, where the user can decide to agree or not.

19. Explain Higher Order Functions in javascript.
  --> Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions.
